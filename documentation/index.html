<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>This site is project for web publishing.</p>
<p>I used 3 layouts: <b>default</b> - primary layout with header, footer and content place, <b>list</b> to show our
    collection of projects and <b>project</b> for showing information about the project with code example.
    You can click on the links or you can find them directly with urls
    (for example ~{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/AVL-tree.md %})</p>
<p>This projects are created as <b>collection</b>. In jekyll I just created corresponding folder with my
    projects in markdown and then listed them easily with the for cycle.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a number of useful Liquid additions as <b>filters</b>: number of words, date to long, to integer
    and <b>tags</b>: highlight, baseurl.</p>
<p>In my site is <b>youtube plugin</b> also used to showing videos directly here. I just had to add this lines in my
    Gemfile and refresh the site:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-youtube"
end
{% endhighlight %}
