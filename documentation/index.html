<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>This site is project for web publishing. It is created as static website using jekyll. The site is written
in HTML, enhanced with jekyll additions. The look of the page is created with CSS.</p>
<p>I used 3 layouts: <b>default</b> - primary layout with header, footer and content place, <b>list</b> to show our
    collection of projects and <b>project</b> for showing information about the project with code examples.
    You can click on the links or you can find them directly with urls
    (for example ~{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/AVL-tree.md %})</p>
<p>These layout uses <b>variables</b> from corresponding sites, where are defined. For example project variables
    as date, title, subject, semester, language and teacher. It is clever, that I don't need to write just html,
 but can use these variables and jekyll creates the full content.</p>
<p>This projects are created as <b>collection</b>. In jekyll I just created corresponding folder with my
    projects in markdown and then listed them easily with the for cycle.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a number of useful liquid additions as <b>filters</b>: number-of-words, date-to-long, to-integer
    and <b>tags</b>: highlight, baseurl.</p>
<p>In my site is <b>youtube plugin</b> also used to showing videos directly here. I just had to add this lines in my
    Gemfile and refresh the site:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-youtube"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<p>In the second assignment my task was convert my bachelor's thesis into DocBook.</p>
<p>Here I changed Latex tags into DocBook elements, for example in <b>title site</b>: title, subtitle,
    author, othername(name of my supervisor) and pubdate. Then I created <b>abstracts</b> in two languages with elements abstract,
    which contains title and para elements, where is text written. Similarly I made <b>content</b> of the document
    with elements chapter, sections and para.</p>
<p>
    This DocBook contains automatic generated <b>table of content, figures and tables</b> in the begin of document.
    They also reference to specific sites in the document. In the text are also used <b>links</b> to images, tables and
    titles of some chapters, created with elements xref.
</p>
<p>
    In the end of the document is <b>appendix</b> and <b>keywords</b> - index of the most important terms. Last part of the
    document contains <b>bibliography</b>, which is cited in the text.
</p>
<p>
    DocBook has also own <b>XSL file</b>, where is style of the document defined. Here I changed a few attributes
    (tables, names of chapters, some spaces, etc.), to get more beautiful appearance of my document.
</p>

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>
    Third assignment was to make a XML presentation about some topic and make transformations to XHTML and PDF.
</p>
<p>
    I created <b>XML file</b> with information about AES - Advanced Encryption Standard. I used <b>RelaxNG</b> to validate this document.
    Next step was to create <b>2 XSL files</b> to transform XML files into XHTML or PDF. In these files i used XSL expressions to 
    get certain part of XML document and then to apply some styles to them. 
</p>
<p>
    I also used <b>XPATH</b> expressions to do some magic with image numbers, with creating slides and creating number of current 
    slide on footer.
    In XSL files some style <b>parameters</b> can be simply changed directly, where they are defined. 
    Then there are applied to all styles in the document. Slides have also own CSS file, where are the main styles defined. 
</p>
<p>
    To make a tranformations into XHTML or PDF i used <b>BAT</b> file, where i define used saxon, files which i used and outputs.
