<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>This site is project for web publishing. It is created as static website using jekyll. The site is written
in HTML, enhanced with jekyll additions. The look of the page is created with CSS.</p>
<p>I used 3 layouts: <b>default</b> - primary layout with header, footer and content place, <b>list</b> to show our
    collection of projects and <b>project</b> for showing information about the project with code examples.
    You can click on the links or you can find them directly with urls
    (for example ~{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/AVL-tree.md %})</p>
<p>These layout uses <b>variables</b> from corresponding sites, where are defined. For example project variables
    as date, title, subject, semester, language and teacher. It is clever, that I don't need to write just html,
 but can use these variables and jekyll creates the full content.</p>
<p>This projects are created as <b>collection</b>. In jekyll I just created corresponding folder with my
    projects in markdown and then listed them easily with the for cycle.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a number of useful liquid additions as <b>filters</b>: number-of-words, date-to-long, to-integer
    and <b>tags</b>: highlight, baseurl.</p>
<p>In my site is <b>youtube plugin</b> also used to showing videos directly here. I just had to add this lines in my
    Gemfile and refresh the site:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-youtube"
end
{% endhighlight %}
